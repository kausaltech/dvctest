      Emission factors represent those for avoided emissions from a facility with
      landfill gas capture but no energy production.\n\nICLEI recommends using the
      same emission factors that were used in past inventories.<br/>waste_emission_factor

      Assumes green waste. Values are adjusted to CH4 and N2O emission factors.\n\n
      These emission factors represent the emissions associated with food waste decomposing,
      which emits methane and N2O. <br/>waste_emission_factor - Ghg: CO2e - Waste:

      value represents the \"avoided emissions\" of sending compost to the landfill
      and properly treating compost so it can be utilized by the community."
